This project is a simulation platform for the CAN protocol and its transfer protocol variants, such as CAN-TP, written in the C++ language and incorporating object-oriented programming principles and polymorphic architecture.
The aim is to conserve the scalability and durability of the system.
The objective is to create a digital environment in which we can test and evaluate code and ECU components, whether they are transmitters or receivers.
The tests cover everything from creating frames to the transfer process.
This project was completed during a summer internship at the PrimaTec company, which has recently been acquired by KPIT.
